# Web-Scrapping-of-Flipkart-Data

# Objective :-

Web scraping is commonly used to gather information from a webpage. Using this technique, we are able to extract a large amount of data and then save it. We can use this data at many places later according to our needs.  

# What we have to do ?

For Scraping data, we need to import a few modules. These modules did not come with the Python package so we need to install these.

- On Flipkart, you can scrape basic product information from the listing pages, just like on most online shopping platforms.
 [ Product titles, ratings, prices, discounts, etc. ], are all available for data extraction on these pages.


# To extract data using web scraping with python, you need to follow these basic steps:

- Find the URL that you want to scrape.
  
- Inspecting the Page.

- Find the data you want to extract.

- Write the code.
  
- Run the code and extract the data.
